# Bagged filters #

This project develops material investigating bagged particle filter algorithms

Near the top of ms.Rnw there is a setting
```
run_level <- 1
```
which runs a quick version of the code for testing and debugging. Uncomment
```
run_level <- "jasa-sept-2020"
```
for a full version of the computations.
